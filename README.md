About the Site:
Welcome to our website! Here's a quick overview:

My site serves as a portfolio that made during studies at huckerU College.
Our site relies on the following technologies:

Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and enhanced with Bootstrap for a polished look.
Fonts: We use stylish fonts from Google Fonts to enhance the reading experience.
Icons: Sprinkled with icons from Font Awesome to add visual appeal.
I value user feedback and engagement. Reach out to me at koralmoryosef@gmail.com if you have suggestions or want to get involved.

Thanks for visiting! hope you enjoy your experience on my site.
